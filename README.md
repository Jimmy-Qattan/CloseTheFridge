# This project is an Arduino based project where you put it in the fridge, and it will tell you to Close your damn fridge when you forget to close it, ya dingus!

## Steps for putting this project together:

REMEMBER TO CONNECT THE GROUND COMPONENT OF THE ARDUINO TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BREADBOARD, AND THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BREADBOARD TO THE 5V COMPONENT OF THE ARDUINO COMPONENT.

# The first few steps apply to the LCD Display moldule of this project:
1) Connect the K component of the LCD Display to the Negative side of the Breadboard, AKA the Ground of the breadboard.
2) Connect the A component of the LCD Display to the Positive side of the Breadboard, AKA the 5V of the breadboard.
3) Connect the D7 component of the LCD Display to the Digital PIN 12 of the Arduino.
4) Connect the D6 component of the LCD Display to the Digital PIN 11 of the Arduino.
5) Connect the D5 component of the LCD Display to the Digital PIN 10 of the Arduino.
6) Connect the D4 component of the LCD Display to the Digital PIN 9 of the Arduino.
7) Connect the E component of the LCD Display to Digital PIN 8 of the Arduino.
8) Connect the RW component of the LCD Display to Negative side of the breadboard, AKA the Ground of the breadboard.
9) Connect the RS component of the LCD Display to the Digital PIN 7 of the Arduino.
10) Connect the V0 component of the LCD Display to a 10K Resister on the breadboard.
11) Connect both sides of the 10K resister to the positive side of the breadboard, and the negative side of the breadboard, AKA the 5V and Ground components of the breadboard.
12) Connect the VDD component of the LCD Display to the Positive side of the breadboard, AKA the 5V component of the breadboard.
13) Connect the VSS component of the LCD Display to the Negative side of the breadboard, AKA the ground component of the breadboard.

# The next few steps will refer to the Ultrasonic sensor module of this project:
1) Connect the VCC component of the Ultrasonic sensor to the Positive side of the breadboard, AKA the 5V part of the breadboard.
2) Connect the Trig component of the Ultrasonic sensor to the Digital PIN 2 of the Arduino Component.
3) Connect the Echo component of the Ultrasonic sensor to the Digital PIN 3 of the Arduino Component.
4) Connect the GND component of the Ultrasonic sensor to the Negative side of the breadboard, AKA the Ground part of the breadboard.

# The next few steps will aply to the Active Buzzer module of this project:
1) Connect one output pin of the Active Buzzer to the Negative side of the breadboard, AKA the Ground component of the breadboard.
2) Connect the other output pin to the Digital PIN 4 of the Arduino Component.
3) If this combination does not work, then try switching the pins around to see if that works. This is because there are no labels on the buzzer itself.
